naming can be approached algorithmically 
- determine substitutions
- determine corresponding numberings
- find starting branch with smallest numbering
- proceed alphabetically


the Crown conformation of cyclohexane is the highest energy conformer because every C is eclipsed

the chair conformation is fully staggered hence most stable and loewst energy
hydrogens in chair adopt an axial or equatorial position
