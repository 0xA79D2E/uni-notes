<!-- What is required if a man hopes to realize the most from his efforts and become a champion? 

The answer: an attitude befitting a hero, one full of fury - an attitude I call siege mentality. Once he enters the field, all else is forgotten and he is transformed into a valiant warrior with girded loins, ready to do battle with the task at hands. -->

This is where you will win the battle - in the playhouse of your mind.
