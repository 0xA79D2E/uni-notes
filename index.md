**Q**: What is required if a man hopes to realize the most from his efforts and become a champion? 

**A**: an attitude befitting a hero, one full of fury - an attitude I call siege mentality. Once he enters the field, all else is forgotten and he is transformed into a valiant warrior with girded loins, ready to do battle with the task at hands.
