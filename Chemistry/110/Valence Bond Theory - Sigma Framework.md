## Overview
Valence Bond (VB) Theory describes chemical bonding as the overlap of atomic orbitals, forming bonds between atoms.

## Key Concepts
1. **Orbital Overlap**: A bond forms when atomic orbitals of two atoms overlap.
2. **Sigma ($\sigma$) Bonds**: Strongest type of covalent bond, formed by end-to-end (head-on) orbital overlap.
3. **Hybridization**: Mixing of atomic orbitals to form hybrid orbitals for bonding.

## Types of Hybridization and Geometry
| Hybridization | Orbitals Mixed | Geometry | Example |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| sp          | 1 s + 1 p    | Linear (180°) | BeCl2  |
| sp2         | 1 s + 2 p    | Trigonal planar (120°) | BF3  |
| sp3         | 1 s + 3 p    | Tetrahedral (109.5°) | CH4  |
| sp3d        | 1 s + 3 p + 1 d | Trigonal bipyramidal | PCl5  |
| sp3d2       | 1 s + 3 p + 2 d | Octahedral | SF6  |

## Formation of Sigma Bonds
- **s-s Overlap**: Two s orbitals overlap (e.g., H2 molecule).
- **s-p Overlap**: An s and a p orbital overlap (e.g., HCl).
- **p-p Overlap**: Two p orbitals overlap head-on (e.g., Cl2).
- **Hybrid Orbital Overlap**: Hybridized orbitals form stronger sigma bonds (e.g., CH4).

## Properties of Sigma Bonds
- **Stronger than $\pi$ bonds** due to maximum overlap.
- **Allow free rotation** around the bond axis.
- **Present in all single bonds** (e.g., C-C, C-H in methane).

## Applications
- **Explains molecular geometries** based on orbital overlap.
- **Predicts bond strength and stability** in molecules.
- **Helps understand chemical reactivity**, e.g., why C-H bonds are strong but reactive in combustion.
