Hydrocarbons that contain one or more double bonds (alkenes) or triple bonds (alkynes).

- the central $C$ atoms in *ethene* are $sp^2$ hybridized $\to$ **trigonal planar** geometry; bond angles of 120
	- alkenes with one double bond $\to$ general formula $C_n H_{2n}$ 
- central $\ce{C}$ in *ethyne* are $sp$ hybridized $\to$ **linear** geometry; bond angles of 180
	- alkynes with one triple bond $\to$ gen. formula $\ce{C_nH_{2n-2}}$ 


## Configuration Isomerism
Acyclic alkenes may exhibit **[[configurational isomerism]]**.
- double bond locks geometry and preserves spatial rel. between subs.
- acyc. alkenes with 2 different groups on each $sp^2$ $C$ of the double bond, such as 2-pentene, are classified as **[[cis-trans isomers]]**. 


##### Identifying a geometric isomer:
1. is there a double bond
2. are there  2 subs.
3. are those 2 subs on each sp2 orbital (i.e. $\ce{C}$ atoms) of the double bond

- *cis* implies groups (here 2 $H$ atoms) on the same side of the double bond
- *trans* implies opposite

>*1-bromo-2-chloro-1-propene*

- *cis-trans* notation cannot be used to express the configuration of this stereoisomer because there are **four different** groups attached to the carbons of the double bond
