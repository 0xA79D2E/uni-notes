## Dipole Moments and Molecular Geometry
A dipole moment occurs when there is a separation of charge in a molecule due to differences in electronegativity between atoms.

### Formula for Dipole Moment
$\mu = q \times d$
where:
- $\mu$ = dipole moment (Debye, D)
- $q$ = magnitude of charge
- $d$ = distance between charges

### Factors Affecting Dipole Moments
1. **Electronegativity Difference**: Larger differences result in stronger dipoles.
2. **Molecular Geometry**: Symmetric molecules may have no net dipole moment.
3. **Bond Polarity**: Polar bonds contribute to molecular polarity.

### Examples
| Molecule  | Shape           | Dipole Moment? |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| CO2       | Linear         | No (cancels)  |
| H2O       | Bent           | Yes           |
| CH4       | Tetrahedral    | No (cancels)  |
| NH3       | Trigonal Pyramidal | Yes      |

## Intermolecular Forces (IMFs)
Intermolecular forces arise due to dipole interactions and impact physical properties like boiling points and solubility.

### Types of IMFs
1. **London Dispersion Forces (LDF)**: Weak, temporary dipoles in all molecules.
2. **Dipole-Dipole Interactions**: Occur in polar molecules due to permanent dipoles.
3. **Hydrogen Bonding**: Strong dipole interaction in molecules with H-F, H-O, or H-N bonds.
4. **Ion-Dipole Forces**: Between ions and polar molecules (e.g., salt in water).

### Relative Strengths
$\text{LDF} < \text{Dipole-Dipole} < \text{Hydrogen Bonding} < \text{Ion-Dipole}$

## Applications
- **Predicting Solubility**: "Like dissolves like" (polar dissolves polar).
- **Boiling/Melting Points**: Stronger IMFs lead to higher boiling/melting points.
- **Protein Folding**: Hydrogen bonding shapes biological molecules.
