## Overview
In Valence Bond (VB) Theory, **pi ($\pi$) bonds** form from the **sideways overlap** of atomic orbitals, contributing to double and triple bonds in molecules.

## Formation of Pi Bonds
- Unlike sigma ($\sigma$) bonds, $\pi$ bonds form from **parallel** overlap of **unhybridized p orbitals**.
- Occurs in **double and triple bonds**, where one bond is a sigma bond and the remaining are $\pi$ bonds.

## Examples

| Molecule | Bond Type | Sigma Bonds | Pi Bonds |
|----------|----------|------------|----------|
| Ethene ($C_2H_4$) | Double bond (C=C) | 1 | 1 |
| Ethyne ($C_2H_2$) | Triple bond (Câ‰¡C) | 1 | 2 |
| Benzene ($C_6H_6$) | Delocalized $\pi$ bonds | 6 $\sigma$ | 3 $\pi$ (delocalized) |

## Properties of Pi Bonds
- **Weaker than sigma bonds** due to lesser orbital overlap.
- **Restrict rotation** around the bond axis, leading to **cis-trans isomerism**.
- Found in **conjugated systems**, contributing to delocalization (e.g., benzene, aromatic compounds).

## Bonding in Conjugated Systems
- **Delocalized $\pi$ bonds** occur when p orbitals overlap across multiple atoms.
- Example: **Benzene ($C_6H_6$)** has alternating single and double bonds, forming a **resonance structure**.

## Applications
- Explains **rigidity** in molecules (e.g., why ethene cannot freely rotate).
- Helps in **predicting reactivity** (e.g., electrophilic addition in alkenes, resonance stability in aromatic rings).
- Important in **organic chemistry** and **material science** (e.g., conductive polymers).
