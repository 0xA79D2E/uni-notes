#  Friction

## Static Friction

Static friction is the resistive force between an object and its environment when the object is *not moving* with respect to its environment. It is represented as $\vec{f}_{s}$, and can be calculated with the following formula:

$$\vec{f_s}_{max} = \mu_s F_N$$


where $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction

Static friction opposes the motion that the object would have without friction; that is to say, it acts in *opposition* to the applied force.



$$\text{If } \vec{F\_{applied}} < \vec{f_s}_{max}, \vec{f_s} = \vec{F\_{applied}}$$

The exact instant in time when static friction is overcome by the applied force is known as the *slipping* point, or the point of *impending motion*, after which *kinetic* friction takes its place.

## Kinetic Friction

Static friction is the resistive force between an object and its environment when the object is *sliding* across a surface with respect to its environment. It is represented as $\vec{f}_{k}$, and can be calculated with the following formula:

$$\vec{f_k} = \mu_{k} F_{N}$$

where $\mu _{k}$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction[^1]

$\vec{f}{k}$ has one constant value[^2].


### Notes


$\mu_{k}$ and $\mu _s$ are dimensionless  (i.e. they do not possess units).

$\mu_{k}$ and $\mu _s$ are nearly independent of the amount of area undergoing friction

$\mu_{k}$ is nearly independent of velocity



[^1]: $\mu_s > \mu_k $

[^2]: $f_{s}max > f_{k}$
