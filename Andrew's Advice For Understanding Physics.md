If physics feels hard, you may not yet see its underlying simplicity. True understanding comes when you grasp the core principles.

All of classical mechanics stems from:

F=dpdt⇒mdvdt=maF = \frac{dp}{dt} \Rightarrow m \frac{dv}{dt} = ma

This equation shows that force changes momentum, which in turn causes acceleration.

In circular motion, even if speed is constant, velocity changes direction, meaning momentum changes. Since F=dp/dtF = dp/dt, this requires a force—hence, circular motion always involves acceleration.

Physics isn’t complex—it’s just deeply connected. Find the core idea, and everything follows.
